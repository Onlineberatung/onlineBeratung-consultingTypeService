# Caritas Online-Beratung ConsultingTypeService
The ConsultingTypeService provides all settings for every single consulting type. It also provides an admin API with which it is possible to retrieve the consulting type settings. Currently, it does not contain authorization within the public REST API calls.

You can easily create new consulting type settings which are described [here](../backend/service-configuration.md#consultingtypeservice).

⚠️ Please keep in mind that after making changes to the consulting type settings you need to restart Agency- and UserService (settings are being cached)! ⚠️
