# Online-Beratung ConsultingTypeService
The ConsultingTypeService provides all settings for every single consulting type. Currently it doesn't contain authorization within the public REST API calls.
It also provides an admin API with which it is possible to retrieve the consulting type settings.

You can easily create new consulting type settings which is described [here](../backend/service-configuration.md#consultingtypeservice).

⚠️ Please keep in mind that after making changes to the consulting type settings you need to restart Agency- and UserService (settings are being cached)! ⚠️
